## Reproducible Research

> From the same raw data someone else should be able to reproduce your results on their computer.

<div class="double">
<p class="double-flow">

### Version 1

- Script
- Supporting package (library)

</p><p class="double-flow">

### Version 2

- Makefile (or remake)
- Supporting package (library)

</p>
</div>

## Reproducible Pipelines

<div class="double">
<p class="double-flow">

### GNU Make

- Everyone's got it
- Mix R any Python (+1 for feather)

</p><p class="double-flow">

### remake / snakemake

- Objects as targets
